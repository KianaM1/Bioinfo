# Solution to Assignment 6

## 1. Transform last week's bash script into a makefile.
- Include rules for obtaining the genome and downloading reads from SRA
- Index the genome
- Generate a sorted and indexed BAM file using align
- Explain the use of the Makefile

## 2. Visualize the BAM file for both simulated reads and reads downloaded from SRA.

## 3. Generate alignment stats for the BAM file.
- What percentage of reads aligned to the genome?
- What was the expected average coverage?
- What is the observed average coverage?
- How much does the coverage vary across the genome? (Provide a visual estimate.)
