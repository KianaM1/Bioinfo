# Solution to Assignment 12
I decided to go with option 1, evaluate alignments across sequencing platforms, which involves comparing alignment quality across different sequencing technologies (e.g., Illumina NovaSeq, Element Aviti, PacBio Revio, Oxford Nanopore).

## 1. Download BAM files for the same region from 2-3 different platforms

## 2. Compare alignment statistics (read depth, mapping quality, coverage uniformity)

## 3. Visualize alignments in IGV and document platform-specific differences
