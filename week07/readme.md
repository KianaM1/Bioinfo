# Solution to Assignment 7

## 1. Add code to last week's Makefile to create BigWig coverage tracks.
In your README.md, demonstrate the use of your Makefile to generate a BAM file for:
- The original data
- The second sequencing data obtained with a different instrument

## 2. Visualize the GFF annotations and both wiggle and BAM files in IGV.

## 3. Answer the following questions:
- Briefly describe the differences between the alignment in both files.
- Briefly compare the statistics for the two BAM files.
- How many primary alignments does each of your BAM files contain?
- What coordinate has the largest observed coverage? (hint: samtools depth)
- Select a gene of interest. How many alignments on the forward strand cover the gene?
